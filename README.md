# Noctifer-Gallery
A small, single-file PHP script that handles everything you need in order to turn a directory into an online image gallery. It contains both a thumbnail browser and an image viewer. The browser shows thumbnails for supported image files (currently jpg, png, gif), and lists subdirectories for navigation. It automatically creates thumbnails of new files (given appropriate writing permissions). The image viewer can show images at 100% of their size, or fit them to the screen, and can be controlled by keyboard. Two colour schemes are included, which can be easily customised. [This online example](http://files.noctifer.net/2014_california/) uses the dark colour scheme.
